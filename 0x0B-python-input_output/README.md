#  Python - Input/Output

In Python, input and output (I/O) is used to interact with the user and the outside world. There are several ways to handle I/O in Python, including:

    print() function: This is the most basic way to output information to the user. The print() function takes one or more arguments, and displays them on the screen.

input() function: This function is used to get input from the user. The input is read as a string, so if you need to use the input as a number, you will need to convert it

Reading and writing files: You can read and write to files on your system using the built-in open() function. Once you have a file object, you can read from or write to it using methods like read(), readline(), write()
