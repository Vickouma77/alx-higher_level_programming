# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
This repository contains examples and explanations of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript, such as Objects, Scopes, and Closures. Understanding these concepts is essential to writing effective JavaScript code and building scalable applications.

## Objects
Objects are one of the most important features of JavaScript. They allow you to represent data in a structured way, and provide a powerful set of tools for manipulating that data. This section covers the basics of working with objects in JavaScript, including object literals, object properties, and object methods.

## Scopes
JavaScript has two types of scopes: global scope and local scope. Understanding how these scopes work is crucial to writing maintainable and bug-free code. This section covers the basics of scopes in JavaScript, including function scope, block scope, and lexical scope.

## Closures
Closures are one of the most powerful and versatile features of JavaScript. They allow you to create functions that have access to variables and parameters from their parent function, even after that parent function has completed execution. This section covers the basics of closures in JavaScript, including lexical scoping and closure examples.
